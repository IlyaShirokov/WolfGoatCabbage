Solving the classical modified problem (a river crossing puzzle) using the Qt framework


Conditions of the problem:
On the left bank are creatures, some of which can eat others. The boatman must transfer them all on a boat of a given capacity and in the shortest possible time so that incompatible creatures would not remain on the shore without him. Set: the capacity of the boat, the table of incompatibilities and the number of different creatures.
